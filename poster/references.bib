  abstract = {Prioritizing the risk posed by thousands of chemicals potentially present in the  environment requires exposure, toxicity, and toxicokinetic (TK) data, which are  often unavailable. Relatively high throughput, in vitro TK (HTTK) assays and in  vitro-to-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) methods have been developed to predict TK,  but most of the in vivo TK data available to benchmark these methods are from  pharmaceuticals. Here we report on new, in vivo rat TK experiments for 26  non-pharmaceutical chemicals with environmental relevance. Both intravenous and oral  dosing were used to calculate bioavailability. These chemicals, and an additional 19  chemicals (including some pharmaceuticals) from previously published in vivo rat  studies, were systematically analyzed to estimate in vivo TK parameters (e.g.,  volume of distribution [Vd], elimination rate). For each of the chemicals,  rat-specific HTTK data were available and key TK predictions were examined: oral  bioavailability, clearance, Vd, and uncertainty. For the non-pharmaceutical  chemicals, predictions for bioavailability were not effective. While no  pharmaceutical was absorbed at less than 10{\%}, the fraction bioavailable for  non-pharmaceutical chemicals was as low as 0.3{\%}. Total clearance was generally more  under-estimated for nonpharmaceuticals and Vd methods calibrated to pharmaceuticals  may not be appropriate for other chemicals. However, the steady-state, peak, and  time-integrated plasma concentrations of nonpharmaceuticals were predicted with  reasonable accuracy. The plasma concentration predictions improved when experimental  measurements of bioavailability were incorporated. In summary, HTTK and IVIVE  methods are adequately robust to be applied to high throughput in vitro toxicity  screening data of environmentally relevant chemicals for prioritizing based on human  health risks.},

  abstract = {Time courses of compound concentrations in plasma are used in chemical safety analysis to evaluate the relationship between external administered doses and internal tissue exposures. This type of experimental data is rarely available for the thousands of non-pharmaceutical chemicals to which people may potentially be unknowingly exposed but is necessary to properly assess the risk of such exposures. In vitro assays and in silico models are often used to craft an understanding of a chemical's pharmacokinetics; however, the certainty of the quantitative application of these estimates for chemical safety evaluations cannot be determined without in vivo data for external validation. To address this need, we present a public database of chemical time-series concentration data from 567 studies in humans or test animals for 144 environmentally-relevant chemicals and their metabolites (187 analytes total). All major administration routes are incorporated, with concentrations measured in blood/plasma, tissues, and excreta. We also include calculated pharmacokinetic parameters for some studies, and a bibliography of additional source documents to support future extraction of time-series. In addition to pharmacokinetic model calibration and validation, these data may be used for analyses of differential chemical distribution across chemicals, species, doses, or routes, and for meta-analyses on pharmacokinetic studies.},

The choice of LS method depends on the variance model. Some discussion is  also provided of computer methods used to find the LS estimates, identifiability,  and robust LS-based estimation methods.},

  abstract = {The biological half-life (t1/2) of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in male rats is 70  times longer than that in female rats. The difference is mainly due to the  difference in renal clearance (CL(R)), which was significantly reduced by  probenecid, suggesting that PFOA is excreted by organic anion transporter(s).  Castration of male rats caused a 14-fold increase in the CL(R) of PFOA, which made  it comparable with that of female rats. The elevated PFOA CL(R) in castrated males  was reduced by treating them with testosterone. Treatment of male rats with  estradiol increased the CL(R) of PFOA. In female rats, ovariectomy caused a  significant increase in CL(R) of PFOA, which was reduced by estradiol treatment.  Treatments of female rats with testosterone reduced the CL(R) of PFOA as observed in  castrated male rats. To identify the transporter molecules that are responsible for  PFOA transport in rat kidney, renal mRNA levels of organic anion transporter 1  (OAT1), OAT2, OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1 (oatp1), oatp2 and  kidney specific organic anion transporter (OAT-K) were determined in male and female  rats under various hormonal states and compared with the CL(R) of PFOA. The level of  OAT2 mRNA in male rats was only 13{\%} that in female rats. Castration or estradiol  treatment increased the level of OAT2 mRNA whereas treatment of castrated male rats  with testosterone reduced it. In contrast to OAT2, mRNA levels of both oatp1 and  OAT-K were significantly higher in male rats compared with female rats. Castration  or estradiol treatment caused a reduction in the levels of mRNA of oatp1 and OAT-K  in male rats. Ovariectomy of female rats significantly increased the level of OAT3  mRNA. Multiple regression analysis suggests that the change in the CL(R) of PFOA is,  at least in part, due to altered expression of OAT2 and OAT3.},

It is shown in this paper that this approximation, based on local expansion of H, can lead to large deviations from the exact values whenever the truncation of L after the second term of the expansion is not sufficient. Furthermore, a method for continuously monitoring the validity of this approximation is proposed, and an alternative procedure is examined for the computation of Vϑ, whenever the usual estimation based on the hessian matrix cannot be used.},
